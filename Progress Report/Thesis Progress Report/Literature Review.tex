\subsubsection{Principles of Aeroelasticity (1962)}
Written by Raymond L. Bisplinghoff and Holt Ashely from MIT, this book helped to source the aeroelastic equations of motion and also provided a reasonably detailed process on how to solve for the flutter velocity in one, two, and three dimensions.  This piece of literature also provided many references to find more detail and further explanations into how the general process of solving for the flutter velocity is done.  One notable example was a reference to NACA Report  496 which outlined a very detailed process on solving the equations of motion.  After reading this piece of literature I was able to begin forming the process for the theoretical simulation and work out where the remaining gaps were.  For example, I required more information to solve for $C(k)$.
